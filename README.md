# Orisium

Orisium is a high-performance peer-to-peer (P2P) network designed for global scalability, attack resilience, and robust decentralization. With a dynamic hierarchical architecture and a specialized UDP-based protocol, Orisium creates a strong foundation for future decentralized applications.

## Key Features

### **Dynamic Hierarchical Network Architecture with 313 Shards**

Orisium adopts a layered network structure for extreme scalability and resilience. There is no fixed root â€” a root can be automatically replaced based on horizontal evaluation by other roots.

  * **313 Shards = 313 Root Nodes**

      * Each root has:
          - **25 downstreams** (Level-1)
          - **312 horizontal connections** to other roots (partial mesh)

  * **Level-1 Nodes:**

      - Connects to **1 upstream Root**
      - Has **24 horizontal connections** to other Level-1 nodes within the same shard
      - Can have up to **25 downstreams** (Level-2)

  * **Level-2 to Level-4 Nodes:**

      - The hierarchical structure continues with the same pattern
      - Each node has:
          - **1 upstream**, **24 horizontal**, and a maximum of **25 downstreams**

*Note: The numbers and details mentioned above are a representation of the initial design. These figures may change as development progresses and based on the results of rigorous performance testing, to ensure the network operates at an optimal level.*

### **Deterministic Routing & Reconnect**

This protocol guarantees reliable connectivity through a **deterministic** routing and connection recovery system. This approach ensures each node can efficiently find its path within the network and can automatically recover its connection if a failure occurs.

  * Each new client node will initiate its first connection to a **Root Node**.
  * The Root will evaluate the network topology and route the node to the most suitable **upstream** (e.g., a Level-1 Node) to optimize its path.
  * Once connected, the node stores its latest upstream information in a local file or DB. This process ensures **session persistence** even after a restart or crash.
  * When a node fails or disconnects, it will first attempt to reconnect to the same upstream. If this attempt fails, the node will automatically **fall back to a Root Node** to get a new route assignment.

### **Automatic Recovery from Node Failure**

Orisium implements a highly efficient and self-healing mechanism to handle node failures.

  * **Fast Peer-to-Peer Recovery**: When a node fails, its horizontal peers (nodes at the same hierarchical level) will coordinate to quickly promote a replacement from the failed node's downstreams. This is done deterministically based on pre-defined criteria.
  * **Proactive Redundancy**: The network will not only recover at the downstream level but will also **replace the lost node**. One of the downstreams of the failed node will be promoted and take over the upstream role for the other downstreams.
  * **Decentralized Decision-Making**: This mechanism reduces the burden on the root node and ensures that every network segment always has an active upstream, preventing the creation of isolated sub-trees.

This approach creates a truly resilient and decentralized network, where every node has a clear strategy to ensure uninterrupted connectivity.

### **Custom Protocol over UDP**

Orisium strategically avoids TCP for inter-node connections, opting for a custom-built, lightweight protocol over UDP. This approach provides **full control** over the data transmission process, resulting in **ultra-low latency** and high performance.

This protocol manually implements key functions like session management, window control, message ordering, and selective retransmission, ensuring reliability without the unnecessary overhead of a standard protocol.

### **Advanced Connection Strategy**

To ensure efficient direct connections between nodes, Orisium does not rely on relay servers that can burden bandwidth. Instead, we use a layered strategy, with **UDP-based NAT hole punching** as its main mechanism.

This technique allows two nodes behind a firewall or NAT to efficiently create a direct communication path, fundamentally increasing decentralization and resilience by reducing reliance on central servers.

#### ðŸ“¦ Components

| Component | Count | Primary Task |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `logic` | 4 | Protocol state machine, connection control, handshake, upstream/downstream, reliability |
| `master` | 1 | Main UDP listener, disassembles header, and forwards to `sio` |
| `sio` | 2 | Initial parsing, checksum verification, internal packet routing |
| `cow` | 5 | Outbound client for horizontal and upstream connections. The Root requires up to 317 active sessions, and one `cow` process can handle up to 65 sessions through `connection_id` multiplexing. |
| `r-lmdb` | 5 | Local database reader (read-only) |
| `w-lmdb` | 1 | Local database writer (write-heavy) |

*Note: The counts and functions of the components listed above are a representation of the initial design. These details may change as development progresses and based on the results of performance testing.*

#### ðŸ”Œ Internal Communication

  - **Unix Domain Socket (UDS)**: Used for inter-process communication (IPC), faster and more secure than local TCP/UDP.
  - This design avoids shared memory, reducing the potential for race conditions and making it easier to debug each module independently.
